# Envdb - Environment Database

* NOTE: envdb is still beta software.

<img style="float:left;" height="244px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mephux/envdb/master/data/envdb.gif?token=AABXAYgKkzBNt0LlqD4LsRb9kpvnzp1aks5VKIX0wA%3D%3D">

Envdb turns your production, dev, cloud, etc environments into a database 
cluster you can search using [osquery](https://github.com/facebook/osquery) as the foundation.

Envdb allows you to register each computer, server or asset as a node in a cluster. Once a new
node is connected it becomes available for search from the Envdb ui.

Envdb was built using golang so the whole application, node client and server comes as one single binary.
This makes it really easy to deploy and get working in seconds.

# How it works.

Envdb wraps the osquery process with a node agent (node as in cluster node) that can communicate back to a central location.
When that node gets a new query, it's executed and then sent back to the tcp server for rendering. Once the
request is processed it's then sent to any avaliable web clients using websockets.

Envdb has an embedded sqlite database for node storage and saved searches.

ui --websockets--> server --tcp--> node client.

## Moving Forward

I plan to add support for a plugin interface for extending what Envdb can request from a node. Currently that list of planned extentions includes: ~~[yara](http://plusvic.github.io/yara/)~~ (osquery is adding support for this), [bro](https://www.bro.org/) and [memory](Volatility). The hope is to wrap these processes and query them using sql like osquery and allowing you to join on similar data points. 

Example: `select * from listening_ports a join bro_conn b on a.port = b.source_port;`

# Download

Pre-built versions of envdb are avaliable for linux 386/amd64. 
[linux downloads](https://github.com/mephux/envdb/releases)

Building on macosx is easy tho, checkout the section below.

# Building

  Make sure you have Go installed. I used Go version 1.4.1.

  * `go get github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...`
  * `go get github.com/elazarl/go-bindata-assetfs`
  * `go get github.com/tools/godep`
  * `git clone https://github.com/mephux/envdb.git`
  * `cd envdb`
  * `make`

# Usage

  * NOTICE: The default username and password for the UI.
    * username: **admin@envdb.io**
    * password: **envdb**

```
usage: envdb [<flags>] <command> [<flags>] [<args> ...]

The Environment Database - SELECT * FROM awesome;

Flags:
  --help       Show help.
  --debug      Enable debug logging.
  --dev        Enable dev mode. (read assets from disk and enable debug
               output)
  -q, --quiet  Remove all output logging.

Commands:
  help [<command>]
    Show help for a command.

  server [<flags>]
    Start the tcp server for node connections.

  node --server=127.0.0.1 [<flags>] <node-name>
    Register a new node.
```

  * Server

    `envdb server`

    * Note: By default this will start the tcp server on port 3636 and the web server on port 8080.

  * Node Client

    `sudo envdb node --server <ip to server> SomeBoxName`

  * That's it - it's really that simple.
